              My name is Matthew, and I am a hard-working and enthusiastic
              person who found great passion in computer science. I am a recent
              graduate at City College of New York majoring in Computer Science.
              I was recently a volunteer as a full-stack developer at Helping
              Hands.After my internships and graduation are crawling on me, I am
              looking for new opportunities that can further hone my skills and
              increase my experiences in the field. I love solving problems and
              am great at working as a team. I want to work at Pantheon Labs
              because I also want to help people to bring their ideas into the
              world. Is always my dream to be able to use the things I learn to
              help people and I believe I can do that at Pantheon Labs.
              Furthermore, the position is remote so I can work at home and
              because of this assignment, Pantheon Labs made me feel like is a
              very chill company. Plus the benefits are lit ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.
