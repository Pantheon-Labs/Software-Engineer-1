      <p> I think this position will be a challenge for me, but one I would love to get to know everyone<br></br>
          and what the company does.  I come in with experience with React, Node JS, Heroku so I can hit<br></br> 
          the ground running,but I want to learn Typescript and PostgreSQL while I'm here. If there's 
          room for me to <br></br>
          grow with your company, I'd love to, I'm committed to becoming a full stack engineerer. <br></br>
          That's why I want to work here -- to hit my own goal of becoming a great software developer.</p>
