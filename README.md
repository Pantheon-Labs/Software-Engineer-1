## Reasoning

I built an application for you to review and have fun with. My main focus was to use react hooks with the game. I felt that wasn't enough, to add some personality I researched ways to make the application pop more which is when I came accoss Framer Motion. This was a solution to help get things moving and put some personality into the app!

Hope you enjoy!!
