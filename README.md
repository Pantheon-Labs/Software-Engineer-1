# Sam's Notes Application (that doubles as an "About Me")

## How go we get this thing going?

-   open up two terminals
-   `cd` into the `client` in one and the `server` in the other

In both the `server` terminal and the `client` terminal, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will spin up the `server` on `localhost:5000` and the `client` on `localhost:3000`

When the React App loads, provided the server is running, you should be greated with my Notes application and a selection of "notes".

The application will initially show you the last note, which is the _intro_. Please click around the notes to see their content and learn a little about me (local storage will remember which note you clicked on last so feel free to reload the page).

I hope you enjoy my work!
