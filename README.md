# `Your App Name Here`
Add some pretty documentation here that tells us how to start your app so we can see the awesome thing you built!

Demo: https://primike.github.io/Software-Engineer-I/

Hello my name is Prince Avecillas and this is a NYC guide app. It does not have too many features but I think I may add to this website and improve it in the future. Possibly adding some backend user database sort of like meetup.com 

My news page includes data fetched from the new york times api. You simply create an account and you will get an api key which you can them use in your get requests.

The events page was a not as simple. The information on the events is not hosted online but instead downloadable as a file. This file is updated every 2 weeks and includes all the events for those 2 weeks as a JSON file. I created a repository and deployed a simple html page hosted on gihub that includes this JSON file so I could pull my data from there. The downside to this is that I will have to update this repository with the new data every two weeks. If you want to check it out this is the url 

https://primike.github.io/data/events_300_rss.json

To get this app working all that is needed is to use npm install and all the packages required should install. Then npm start to start the react project. Or you can be lazy and just check out the demo.
